# Microcosm Overview

Every company needs to handle their orders in an organize, efficient manner. We created a database
that would allow the company to effectively manage what customers are int their system, see if
there are duplicate orders, and sort orders by size from smallest to largest. This program will
allow efficient operations to be executed to maintain an organized system to process orders in a
warehouse before they get shipped to our customers.

# Microcosm Indepth

Using our program, users will create a text file in a specific format. This format is the customerâ€™s name, then their order number, and then the number of items in their order. Each line represents a customer and their respective information. The user can either download all of the code from our GitHub Repository or download just the executable file and use the command line argument for the path to the orders file. This will take each line of the text file and construct our database one user at a time, and will allow the user to then perform each operation as desired. These operations can be to check for a duplicate entity in the database, add a new customer, remove a customer, or sort all of the orders by size from smallest to largest.

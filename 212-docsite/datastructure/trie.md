# Trie

The program utilized a trie tree to hold all names in the orders and gives the user the ability to lookup orders by name. While this data structure may use a lot of memory, it is fast in operation allowing for faster querying of names. There is also an implementation of delete which will go through the tree and properly remove any names as needed.

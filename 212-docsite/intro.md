# :) Introduction and Summary

Our group wanted to create a database that would allow a company to efficiently track 
their customer’s information for their orders. Our program will allow users to check 
if a customer’s name exists in the database, sort customer orders by size, and check
to see if there are duplicates in our system. Users are given an input prompt to select 
an operation and are given the appropriate output based on their selection.

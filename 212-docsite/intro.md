# Introduction and Summary

Our team aimed to develop a database designed to streamline a company’s tracking of customer information related to their orders. The functionality of our software includes verifying the existence of a customer’s name in the database, organizing customer orders by size, and identifying potential duplicates within the system. Users interact with the system through an input prompt, which allows them to choose an operation. The system then provides the corresponding output based on their selection.

## Collaboration Information

The scaffolding of our project includes a GitHub repository setup for asynchronous collaboration. We've divided tasks among team members and created a driver class to handle command line arguments and process inputs from txt files.

## Goal

Our aim is to achieve efficiency within our database. We shall do this keeping in mind the handling of large data entries as a future goal.

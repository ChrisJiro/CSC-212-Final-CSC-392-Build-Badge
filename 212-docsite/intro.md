# Introduction and Summary

Our team aimed to develop a database designed to streamline a company’s tracking of customer information related to their orders. The functionality of our software includes verifying the existence of a customer’s name in the database, organizing customer orders by size, and identifying potential duplicates within the system. Users interact with the system through an input prompt, which allows them to choose an operation. The system then provides the corresponding output based on their selection. This will be elaborated on further in the microcosm section.

## Collaboration Information

The scaffolding of our project includes a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ChrisJiro/CSC-212-Final-CSC-392-Build-Badge) that we setup for asynchronous collaboration. We've divided tasks among team members and created a driver class to handle command line arguments and process inputs from txt files.

## Goal

Our aim is to to develop a database, and to achieve efficiency within said database. We have goals to implement more operations in the future, and to optimize where needed.
